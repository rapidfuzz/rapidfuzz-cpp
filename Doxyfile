# If you use STL classes (i.e. std::string, std::vector, etc.) but do not want
# to include (a tag file for) the STL sources as input, then you should set this
# tag to YES in order to let doxygen match functions declarations and
# definitions whose arguments contain STL classes (e.g. func(std::string);
# versus func(std::string) {}). This also make the inheritance and collaboration
# diagrams that involve STL classes more complete and accurate.

# If the HIDE_COMPOUND_REFERENCE tag is set to NO (default) then doxygen will

# The GENERATE_TODOLIST tag can be used to enable (YES) or disable (NO) the todo

# The CITE_BIB_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more bib files containing
# the reference definitions. This must be a list of .bib files. The .bib
# extension is automatically appended if omitted. This requires the bibtex tool
# to be installed. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX for more info.
# For LaTeX the style of the bibliography can be controlled using
# LATEX_BIB_STYLE. To use this feature you need bibtex and perl available in the
# search path. See also \cite for info how to create references.
