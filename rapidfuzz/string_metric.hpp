/**
 * @brief Calculates the minimum number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions
 * required to change one sequence into the other according to Levenshtein with custom
 * costs for insertion, deletion and substitution
 *
 * @tparam Sentence1 This is a string that can be converted to
 * basic_string_view<char_type>
 * @tparam Sentence2 This is a string that can be converted to
 * basic_string_view<char_type>
 *
 * @param s1
 *   string to compare with s2 (for type info check Template parameters above)
 * @param s2
 *   string to compare with s1 (for type info check Template parameters above)
 * @param weights
 *   The weights for the three operations in the form
 *   (insertion, deletion, substitution). Default is {1, 1, 1},
 *   which gives all three operations a weight of 1.
 * @param max
 *   Maximum Levenshtein distance between s1 and s2, that is
 *   considered as a result. If the distance is bigger than max,
 *   -1 is returned instead. Default is std::numeric_limits<std::size_t>::max(),
 *   which deactivates this behaviour.
 *
 * @return returns the levenshtein distance between s1 and s2
 *
 * @remarks
 * @parblock
 * Depending on the input parameters different optimized implementation are used
 * to improve the performance. Worst-case performance is ``O(m * n)``.
 *
 * <b>Insertion = 1, Deletion = 1, Substitution = 1:</b>
 *   - if max is 0 the similarity can be calculated using a direct comparision,
 *     since no difference between the strings is allowed.  The time complexity of
 *     this algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - A common prefix/suffix of the two compared strings does not affect
 *     the Levenshtein distance, so the affix is removed before calculating the
 *     similarity.
 *
 *   - If max is ≤ 3 the mbleven algorithm is used. This algorithm
 *     checks all possible edit operations that are possible under
 *     the threshold `max`. The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - If the length of the shorter string is ≤ 64 after removing the common affix
 *     Hyyrös' algorithm is used, which calculates the Levenshtein distance in
 *     parallel. The algorithm is described by [1]_. The time complexity of this
 *     algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - In all other cases the Levenshtein distance is calculated using
 *     Wagner-Fischer with Ukkonens optimization as described by @cite wagner_fischer_1974.
 *     The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N * M)``.
 *     In the future this should be replaced by Myers algorithm (with blocks),
 *     which performs the calculation in parallel aswell (64 characters at a time).
 *     Myers algorithm is described in @cite myers_1999.
 *
 *
 * <b>Insertion = 1, Deletion = 1, Substitution = 2:</b>
 *   - if max is 0 the similarity can be calculated using a direct comparision,
 *     since no difference between the strings is allowed.  The time complexity of
 *     this algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - if max is 1 and the two strings have a similar length, the similarity can be
 *     calculated using a direct comparision aswell, since a substitution would cause
 *     a edit distance higher than max. The time complexity of this algorithm
 *     is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - A common prefix/suffix of the two compared strings does not affect
 *     the Levenshtein distance, so the affix is removed before calculating the
 *     similarity.
 *
 *   - If max is ≤ 4 the mbleven algorithm is used. This algorithm
 *     checks all possible edit operations that are possible under
 *     the threshold `max`. As a difference to the normal Levenshtein distance this
 *     algorithm can even be used up to a threshold of 4 here, since the higher weight
 *     of substitutions decreases the amount of possible edit operations.
 *     The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - If the length of the shorter string is ≤ 64 after removing the common affix
 *     the BitPAl algorithm is used, which calculates the Levenshtein distance in
 *     parallel. The algorithm is described by @cite bitpal_2014 and is extended with
 *     support for UTF32 in this implementation. The time complexity of this
 *     algorithm is ``O(N)``.
 *
 *   - In all other cases the Levenshtein distance is calculated using
 *     Wagner-Fischer with Ukkonens optimization as described by @cite wagner_fischer_1974.
 *     The time complexity of this algorithm is ``O(N * M)``.
 *     This can be replaced with a blockwise implementation of the BitPal algorithm
 *     in the future.
 *
 * <b>Other weights:</b>
 *   The implementation for other weights is based on Wagner-Fischer.
 *   It has a performance of ``O(N * M)`` and has a memory usage of ``O(N)``.
 *   Further details can be found in @cite wagner_fischer_1974.
 * @endparblock
 *
 * @par Examples
 * @parblock
 * Find the Levenshtein distance between two strings:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // dist is 2
 * std::size_t dist = levenshtein("lewenstein", "levenshtein");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Setting a maximum distance allows the implementation to select
 * a more efficient implementation:
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // dist is -1
 * std::size_t dist = levenshtein("lewenstein", "levenshtein", {1, 1, 1}, 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * It is possible to select different weights by passing a `weight` struct.
 * Internally s1 and s2 might be swapped, so insertion and deletion
 * cost should usually have the same value.

 *   The weights for the three operations in the form
 *   (insertion, deletion, substitution). Default is {1, 1, 1},
 *   which gives all three operations a weight of 1.
 * @param score_cutoff

 *
 * @remarks
 * @parblock
 * Depending on the provided weights the normalisation is performed in different
 * ways:
 *
 * <b>Insertion = 1, Deletion = 1, Substitution = 1:</b>
 *   \f$ratio = 100 \cdot \frac{distance(s1, s2)}{max(len(s1), len(s2))}\f$

 * <b>Insertion = 1, Deletion = 1, Substitution = 2:</b>
 *   \f$ratio = 100 \cdot \frac{distance(s1, s2)}{len(s1) + len(s2)}\f$
 *
 * Different weights are currently not supported, since the library has no algorithm
 * for normalization yet.
